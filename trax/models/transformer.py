  """Returns a list of layers implementing a feedforward block.

  Args:
    d_model: Final dimension of tensors at most points in the model, including
        the initial embedding output.
    d_ff: Size of special dense layer in the feedforward part of each block.
    dropout: Stochastic rate (probability) for dropping an activation value
        when applying dropout within a block.
    dropout_shared_axes: Tensor axes on which to share a dropout mask.
        Sharing along batch and sequence axes (`dropout_shared_axes=(0,1)`) is
        a useful way to save memory and apply consistent masks to activation
        vectors at different sequence positions.
    mode: If `'train'`, each block will include dropout; else, it will
        pass all values through unaltered.
    activation: Type of activation function at the end of each block; must
        be an activation-type subclass of `Layer`.

  Returns:
    A list of layers which maps vectors to vectors.
